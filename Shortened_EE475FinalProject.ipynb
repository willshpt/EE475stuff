This is one of the few projects I was able to find where they were doing almost exactly what I was looking for -- not just detecting the direction of a person's gaze, but rather looking at where on a screen a person was looking. They created the GazeCapture dataset by uploading an application to the iOS app store which would display pulsating red dots on screen at various positions and record the user's face cam as they look at the dots. There are other parts of the application, such as making the user press left or right on the screen depending on if there is an L or an R displayed in the dot, in order to make sure the user is engaged, but otherwise the idea is almost exactly what I was thinking of in order to collect data."
